# Palmer Ridge Programming Club

This repository should provide all of the information you need to
learn how to use the C++ programming language and start making your
own games to go on the arcade machine downstairs.

Start with level 0, and for each level read the info and exercises there.
Once you've completed a level, feel free to move on to the next.
If you have any questions, first try Google, then ask the person next to you,
then try asking me.

Happy Coding!
